# Quarkus-demo Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

It tries to reproduce the issue reported as:

    https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/26848

Issue SHOULD be reproducible by

    ./mvnw clean verify

but as of now that will simply succeed (unlike bigger project from which example is extracted).
